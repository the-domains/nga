# Big Business: Here's how you can respect youth and it's important...
![National grocery stores are severely lacking in policies to show basic support for young people and it's bad for business .  ](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b1f4e753c172a0c144b9bcc02d927a0746bed205.jpg)

You know those ultra-refined chains of grocery stores, hotels and fast food joints? From the crisp edges of the burger wrappers to the well-lit and maintained signs that beacon you into the right location, you would think that they've thought of everything to make the experience of being a consumer a delight---except for the fact that many of these chains are actively teaching young people to avoid them in the future: by ignoring ageism. 
> 
> **I've learned that people will forget what you said, people **_**will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel." **_**― Maya Angelou **

The best for-profit companies have figured out that taking care of the person (read:customer) is the best way to have repeat visits. Young people are actively being tagged as a threat to inventory. One national chain has even outlawed more than two youth entering the store together. As society attempts to dismiss harmful and ineffective stereotypes for other oppressed groups. It seems that ageism is actively encouraged. Young people have been talking about the constant watching, following and nasty treatment they receive on a daily basis. It's a real problem but who has more to lose?

Chain after chain continues to shut down. Remember: Circuit City? BlockBuster? Boarders? What do these 3 ill-fated companies have in common? Their competitors all invested in technology. While the convenience of online shopping is a difficult foe to counter, one thing is for sure; brick and mortar stores need to pay attention to how these online and tech based companies have invested in the next generation.   
  
_**Apple by Steve Jobs: **_

Apple invested huge in the "next generation" by gifting millions of computers, for free, to the same age group that feels watched while shopping for some gamer fuel. Millions of students got trained at school on how to be, well an Macintosh user. When these students got a little older and it was time to hit Circuit City for a new computing device, it was of course a brand new Mac. 

So, what can companies due to respect young people and save themselves from the Going out of Business sale?

1) Promote youth friendly policies and training techniques. Invest in the next generations of consumers by focusing on the experience that young people have in your business.   
  
2) Remove specificity. Beef up overall security. Stop targeting groups of people as higher risk for loss prevention: and you will alienate that group. Assume everyone is out to steal from you and act accordingly.   
  
4) Help your business be accessible to youth. Businesses should work on creating an experience that young consumers will want to return for. When filling out paperwork or making choices on the right kind of product to buy: cater towards the youth culture now and have success with upcoming life long consumers.
